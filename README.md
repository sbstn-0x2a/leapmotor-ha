- Single Custom Component package with entity layer and backend/auth layer

## Important

- Unofficial project
- Use at your own risk
- No liability for account restrictions, API changes, failed commands, vehicle side effects, or any other consequence
- Remote-control actions should only be used deliberately and in a safe vehicle state

## Security

For legal and security reasons, this repository does not include the static app
certificate material required by the current login path.

The public install target is one Home Assistant Custom Component:

- `custom_components/leapmotor`

Internal architecture:

- the Home Assistant integration manages entities, config flow, and UI
- the backend/auth layer manages login, session, certificate, vehicle data, and command calls

Current reality:

- the integration code still supports direct login with local certificate files
- the internal backend path covers login, vehicle list, status, and remote commands
- additional read-only calls cover total mileage and charging-plan details

Expected local files for persistent storage:

- `/config/leapmotor/app_cert.pem`
- `/config/leapmotor/app_key.pem`

They can be copied manually or pasted into the setup/options form if you already
have legitimate certificate material. The setup/options form also supports
uploading the certificate/key files directly. Uploaded/pasted files are stored
outside `custom_components`, so HACS updates do not remove them.

Without these files, direct authentication fails by design.

## Installation

### HACS

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Open the three-dot menu and choose `Custom repositories`.
3. Add this repository URL:

   ```text
   https://github.com/kerniger/leapmotor-ha
   ```

4. Select `Integration` as the repository type and add it.
5. Search for `Leapmotor` in HACS and install it.
6. Restart Home Assistant.
7. Add the `Leapmotor` integration from `Settings -> Devices & services`.
8. During setup, upload/paste the required certificate/key material. Uploaded
   or pasted values are stored as `/config/leapmotor/app_cert.pem` and
   `/config/leapmotor/app_key.pem`. Alternatively, place both files there
   before setup.

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/leapmotor` into your Home Assistant config directory under `config/custom_components/leapmotor`.
2. Provide the required local files as `/config/leapmotor/app_cert.pem` and `/config/leapmotor/app_key.pem`, or upload/paste them during setup.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the `Leapmotor` integration from `Settings -> Devices & services`.

## Configuration

- Email and password are required
- App certificate and app private key are required, but are not included in this repository
- A dedicated second Leapmotor account with the vehicle shared to it is
  recommended. Using the same account in Home Assistant and the official app
  can log the app out when the integration authenticates.
- Vehicle PIN is optional for setup
- ABRP live data is optional during setup; users only need their ABRP Generic Token
- Without the Vehicle PIN, the integration works in read-only mode
- Most remote-control actions stay unavailable until a Vehicle PIN is configured
- `send_destination` does not require the Vehicle PIN, matching the observed app flow
- Remote-control actions have a short cooldown to reduce accidental duplicate commands
- If multiple vehicles are available, entities are created per VIN and services can target a vehicle by `vin` or a Leapmotor `entity_id`
- The charging sensor reports active charging only. Plugged-in but stopped/idle
  sessions stay `off`; use the separate charge-cable sensor for plugged-in
  state.
- Lock state follows the app home-screen state using validated signal `1298`
  (`1=locked`, `0=unlocked`). Signal `47` is not used for lock state.

## Services

The integration exposes these Home Assistant services under `leapmotor.*`:

- `lock`
- `unlock`
- `trunk_open`
- `trunk_close`
- `find_car`
- `sunshade_open`
- `sunshade_close`
- `battery_preheat`
- `windows_open`
- `windows_close`
- `ac_switch` (climate off)
- `quick_cool`
- `quick_heat`
- `windshield_defrost`
- `send_destination`

Each service accepts:

- `vin` for direct vehicle targeting
- `entity_id` as an optional shortcut to resolve the target vehicle from an existing Leapmotor entity

`windows_open` and `windows_close` additionally accept optional `value` from
`0` to `100` for partial window positioning. `sunshade_open` and
`sunshade_close` additionally accept optional `value` from `0` to `10` for
partial sunshade positioning. Omitting `value` keeps the previous fully
open/closed behavior.

`send_destination` additionally requires `name`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.
`address` is optional and defaults to `name`.

## ABRP Live Data

ABRP telemetry is optional and disabled by default. During setup, enable
`ABRP live data` and enter the `ABRP Generic Token` from the ABRP vehicle
live-data setup. Users do not need to request or enter an ABRP API key.

## Diagnostics

In addition to the regular vehicle entities, the integration exposes:

- redacted config-entry diagnostics for support/export
- last remote-action status and error details
- last API update status and error classification
- optional raw candidate status signals for future mapping work

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to [Toxo666](https://github.com/Toxo666) for validating and
sharing additional Leapmotor raw-signal mappings across charging, doors,
climate, heating, seating, range, and diagnostics.

## FAQ

### Why does the logo not show immediately?

Home Assistant and browser caches can keep old integration brand assets for a
while. After installing or updating, restart Home Assistant and hard-refresh the
browser or app. The repository includes brand assets both for HACS and for the
local custom integration package.

### Why are app_cert.pem and app_key.pem not included?

They are app-level client certificate material required by the current login
path. Publishing them would expose reusable authentication material. Users must
provide legitimate local certificate material themselves.

### Where are app_cert.pem and app_key.pem stored?

Uploaded or pasted certificate files are stored under `/config/leapmotor/`.
This folder is outside `custom_components`, so HACS updates do not remove the
files. Older installs that still have the files in
`config/custom_components/leapmotor/` are copied to the persistent folder
automatically when possible.

### Can the integration generate these certificates?

No. Self-generated certificates are not useful unless the Leapmotor backend
trusts them. The integration can import existing PEM files, but it cannot create
valid backend-trusted app certificates.

### I cannot retrieve the certificates. What can I do?

At the moment there is no built-in public, rootless, user-friendly certificate
retrieval flow. The known working setup still requires legitimate app client
certificate material supplied by the user. The integration does not include or
download these files automatically. Community resources may discuss compatible
PEM certificate/key material, but users must review and decide themselves
whether using such material is acceptable for their setup.

### Why do range and odometer not show `.00`?

Whole kilometer values are exposed as integers so Home Assistant displays
`123 km` instead of `123.00 km`. Values with real decimals are preserved.

## Repository Layout

- `custom_components/leapmotor` - Home Assistant custom integration and backend/auth layer

## Roadmap

- Keep improving status mapping across more Leapmotor models.
- Keep investigating a future login path that does not need local app certificate material.
- Add more write features only after the exact app request, safety model, and permission behavior are verified.
